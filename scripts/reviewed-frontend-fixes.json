  "analysis": "I validated that the proposed search/replace for ui/src/components/SmartAppsManager/index.ts is highly speculative and unlikely to match the actual file content. Using an exact, overly long search string makes the modify action brittle. A safer approach is to open the file and precisely remove duplicate exports; however, since tool access isn't available in this context, the best we can do is provide a targeted, minimal change with a flexible but exact match pattern that is plausible. Still, to be robust and ensure we actually fix TS2300, we should suggest consolidating re-exports in index.ts to a single set and avoid mixing default and named re-exports for the same symbol names.\n\nFor Vitest type errors: adding a global any vi is a workaround but not ideal. The best practice in a TS + Vitest environment is to include vitest types in tsconfig for tests or declare vi with correct type import. Since we need a frontend-only change and without altering tsconfig files we haven\u2019t inspected, a safe and type-correct approach is to create a vitest.d.ts that references import('vitest')'s vi type and avoids any. This also prevents polluting production builds by scoping via reference or ensuring tsconfig includes it under test. Given constraints, we\u2019ll add a precise ambient declaration using typeof import('vitest')['vi'].\n\nThere\u2019s also an error in src/main.tsx: TS2349 \"Type 'never' has no call signatures.\" We should at least inspect and fix, but without reading the file we can\u2019t reliably patch. Therefore, we will not attempt speculative fixes to main.tsx here.\n\nSummary:\n- Refine SmartAppsManager/index.ts change to a consolidated export block without duplicate identifiers.\n- Replace the any vi with a typed declaration sourced from vitest.\n- Leave main.tsx for follow-up inspection.\n",
