  "analysis": "I focused on a high-impact, low-risk improvement: adding unit tests for the storage utility getTheme found at ui/src/lib/storage.ts (identified during exploration). This function is commonly a source of edge-case bugs (localStorage missing keys, unexpected values) and is easy to test reliably with Vitest. Adding these tests will cover a currently untested module, improve branch/behavior coverage for theme resolution, and is non-invasive. I created a single comprehensive test file with multiple scenarios (stored value, missing key returns default, stored null behavior and spy usage). I recommend, as follow-ups, adding tests for (a) the setTheme counterpart (if present), (b) ThemeProvider/useTheme edge cases (outside provider throws, inside provider state changes), and (c) an ErrorBoundary component if one exists. These follow-ups will further raise coverage toward the 80% target but I limited changes here to safe, high-confidence additions.",

      "reasoning": "Adds unit tests for getTheme to cover: (1) returning a stored value, (2) returning the default when the key is missing, and (3) behavior when localStorage.getItem returns null. These tests are small, deterministic, and exercise the primary branches that are commonly untested for storage utilities. They should increase coverage meaningfully and are safe to run in the existing Vitest + Testing Library environment.",
