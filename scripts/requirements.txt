# ===== CORE DEPENDENCIES (REQUIRED) =====
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0  # For local .env file support
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.0  # For web scraping
playwright>=1.40.0  # For browser automation
pytest>=7.4.0  # For test generation and execution
selenium>=4.15.0  # For UI testing

# ===== SEMANTIC SEARCH (OPTIONAL - CPU ONLY) =====
 torch>=1.11.0
 sentence-transformers>=2.2.0
 scikit-learn>=1.3.0

# ===== QUICK SETUP COMMANDS =====
# 
# For BASIC usage (no semantic search):
#   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# For FULL features with semantic search (CPU-only, ~100MB):
#   1. First install CPU-only PyTorch:
#      uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
#   2. Then install other ML dependencies:
#      uv pip install sentence-transformers scikit-learn
#   3. Finally install core dependencies:
#      uv pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# The system gracefully falls back to regular search if ML libs aren't installed
