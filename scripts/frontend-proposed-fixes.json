  "analysis": "One test is failing: test/hooks/useTheme.inside-provider.test.tsx expecting the UI to show 'system' after clicking the 'Set System' button but receiving 'light'. The error log also shows React state updates not wrapped in act(...). Root cause is a brittle synchronous assertion made immediately after an event that triggers async state updates (and possibly an unwrapped update). Fixes: (1) make the test await the state change using testing-library's waitFor to avoid race conditions and satisfy React's async update lifecycle; (2) provide a small test helper to ensure user interactions that trigger state updates can be wrapped in act(...) when needed to silence act warnings and make tests robust. These changes are low-impact, follow existing test patterns, and address the failure directly.",
