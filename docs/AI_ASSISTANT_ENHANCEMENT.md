- **OAuth Flows**: Authorization patterns and security
- **Scopes and Permissions**: Resource access control
- **Launch Contexts**: Clinical workflow integration
- **Agent Scopes**: Autonomous system authorization

#### Getting Started Guide
- **Quick Start**: Platform setup and configuration
- **First App Registration**: Step-by-step app setup
- **User Configuration**: Healthcare user management
- **Testing**: Validation and troubleshooting
- **Go-Live Checklist**: Production readiness

### ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

#### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Add to .env file
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

#### 2. Package Installation
```bash
# Already installed
bun add openai @types/mime
```

#### 3. Usage
- Click the sparkles (âœ¨) icon in the navigation
- Ask questions about any platform feature
- Get contextual help with sources
- Navigate to relevant sections based on responses

### ðŸŽ¯ Example Interactions

#### Navigation Help
**User**: "How do I add a new user?"
**AI**: "To manage healthcare users, go to the **Users** section in the navigation. There you can add new healthcare users with professional details, associate users with FHIR Person resources, configure role-based permissions, and monitor user activity."

#### Configuration Guidance
**User**: "What scopes do I need for a patient app?"
**AI**: "For patient-facing apps, use patient/ scopes like `patient/Patient.read`, `patient/Observation.read`, plus `launch` and `launch/patient` for SMART launch functionality. The AI assistant provides detailed scope explanations with examples."

#### Troubleshooting Support
**User**: "My FHIR server is showing as unhealthy"
**AI**: "Check the FHIR Servers section, review connection settings, test authentication, and verify endpoint URLs. The assistant provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance."

### ðŸ”’ Security and Privacy

#### Client-Side Safety
- OpenAI configured with `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` for demo
- **Production Recommendation**: Implement backend proxy for API calls
- No sensitive data sent to OpenAI (only user questions)
- Knowledge base is local and static

#### Fallback Handling
- Works without OpenAI API key (rule-based responses)
- Graceful error handling for API failures
- Local knowledge base ensures core functionality

### ðŸ“ˆ Benefits

#### For Administrators
- **Faster Onboarding**: Get help immediately without documentation hunting
- **Contextual Guidance**: Specific help for current tasks
- **Best Practices**: Built-in knowledge of healthcare standards
- **24/7 Availability**: Always available for guidance

#### For Organizations
- **Reduced Training Time**: Self-service help and guidance
- **Consistent Information**: Standardized responses based on documentation
- **Improved Compliance**: Built-in knowledge of regulatory requirements
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Faster task completion with guided assistance

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

#### Planned Features
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Step-by-step guided workflows
- **Voice Input**: Speech-to-text for hands-free interaction
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Context-aware recommendations
- **Integration Actions**: Direct platform actions from chat
